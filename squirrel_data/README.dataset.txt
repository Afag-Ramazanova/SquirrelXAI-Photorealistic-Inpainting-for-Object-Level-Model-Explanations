Training set of Squirrels in diverse green backgrounds for use in a garden deterent system.

Contains hundreds of annotated images (all classes should be exported to one final class). 

This was intended for an embedded offline system (Raspberry PI with TPU coprocessor) but I have created a cloud version as well. Embedded System uses Google Coral USB Acceelrator and a TensorflowLite Model instead of Yolov8. Trained through model maker.
